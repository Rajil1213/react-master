# Each project is on a separate branch
This repository contains my solution to select mini projects in [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The solutions are also available in the course's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code.git). **However, my implementation is entirely in TypeScript while the original is mostly in plain JavaScript.**

# Aggregated Notes
